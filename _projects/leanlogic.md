title: "Lean Logic and Entailment and Contradiction Detection (ECD)"
year: 2012
venue: "I worked for many years at the Xerox PARC Bridge project and since I am convinced that we did not get to make it as good as it could be, I am engaged in the process of producing a new version, with different tools. Some of this work has to do with lexical resources and connects to the work below. Some has to do with work with Gerard de Melo on the implicative lexicon. Some of it is more theorem proving and connects to work with Vivek Nigam. Some of it is really logic and it may connect to  Linear Logic"
