<h4>Welcome!</h4>

I am a senior Principal  Research Scientist
 at <a href="http://research.nuance.com/"
target="_blank">Nuance Communications</a>.
<br><br>
Once upon a time I finished my Ph.D. under the direction
of <a href="https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~martin/">Martin Hyland</a>,
and my thesis can be
found <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-213.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br><br>
On this page you can  find my research interests, contact
information, and <a href="includes/cv.pdf">CV</a> (Updated
Oct. 2015).

<h4>Research Interests</h4>

My research interests span several areas. To begin with  category theory, programming languages, type theories, and logic in
computer science, in general. Then semantics of Natural Language, logic for semantics and lexical semantics. Then search methods and measurements, knowledge graphs and commonsense ontologies. More fun comes in the shape of linear and modal logic, and applications to mathematics.
